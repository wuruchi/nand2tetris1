# Nand 2 Tetris Part 1

Development and Solutions of the projects of the course From Nand 2 Tetris Part 1

Folders `00` to `06` contain my solutions to the projects of [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/).

The folder `assembler` contains the `python3` code of the assembler I developed to finish project `06`. The structure of the assembler code follows the instructions given in the course and the book, there are some comments for reference.

At some point it is difficult to understand the bridge between logic gates and the `ALU`, or the `ALU` and `Memory` registers and the `CPU`. Honestly, it took me some re-readings of the relevant chapters of the book to grasp the big picture of the projects.

I would recommend this course to anyone interested in understanding how a computer works.

It is really interesting to get your head around how `HDL` works. A programming language that is not interpreted from top to bottom but from left to right all at the same time. It was something new for me.
