# Nand 2 Tetris Part 1

Development and Solutions of the projects of the course From Nand 2 Tetris Part 1

Folders `00` to `06` contain my solutions to the projects of [Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris (Project-Centered Course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/).

The folder `assembler` contains the `python3` code of the assembler I developed to finish project `06`.

At some point it is difficult to understand the bridge between logic gates and the `ALU`, or the `ALU` and `Memory` registers and the `CPU`. Honestly, it took me some re-readings of the relevant chapters of the book to grasp the big picture of the projects. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in understanding how a computer works.
